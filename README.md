# AutoCAD Summer Co-op Projects

Welcome to the AutoCAD Summer Co-op Projects repository! Here you will find a collection of seven of my most significant AutoCAD projects completed during my summer co-op. These files showcase my skills and experience in AutoCAD design and drafting.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following seven AutoCAD files:

1. `Diesel system drawing #1`: Top view of a two-system with a pump. 
2. `Diesel system drawing #2`: Top view and schematic of a diesel system upgrade, but a concrete pad was installed.
3. `Diesel system drawing #3`: Top view and schematic of a diesel system upgrade, but with 15750 LITRE TANK.
4. `Diesel system drawing #4`: Schematic of a common diesel system upgrade. 
5. `Diesel system drawing #5`: Top view and side view of a diesel system demolition and upgrade; external, sub-base tank was used.
6. `Diesel system drawing #6`: Top, side, and schematic view of diesel system upgrade to a Firepump system.
7. `Diesel system drawing #7`: Top view of diesel generator demolition and upgrade.

## About the Projects

Each project represents a unique design challenge and demonstrates my ability to create detailed and precise AutoCAD drawings. These files may include 2D floor plans, elevations, sections, and other technical drawings, depending on the project's requirements.

## Usage

You are welcome to explore these AutoCAD files for reference or inspiration.
## Getting Started

If you are new to AutoCAD or would like to learn more about how these drawings were created, you can follow these steps to get started:

  1. **Install AutoCAD**: If you don't already have AutoCAD installed, you can obtain a copy from the official Autodesk website.

  2. **Clone or Download**: Clone this repository or download the AutoCAD files you are interested in to your local machine.

  3. **Open the Files**: Open the AutoCAD files in AutoCAD software to explore the drawings and understand their structure.

  4. **Learn and Adapt**: Analyze the drawings to understand how different elements were created, such as layers, linetypes, dimensions, and more. You can adapt these techniques to your own projects.
